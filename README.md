# Exploratory Data Analysis of 911 Calls Dataset

## Project Overview

The **"Exploratory Data Analysis of 911 Calls Dataset"** project aims to analyze and gain insights from a dataset containing emergency calls made to 911 services. This dataset typically includes information such as the type of emergency, location, timestamp, and other relevant details. Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, we explore the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that help understand the nature and distribution of emergency incidents.

## Objectives

- Analyze the frequency and distribution of different types of 911 calls.
- Examine temporal trends such as the most common days and hours for emergency calls.
- Explore the geographic distribution of calls across various regions or townships.
- Identify seasonal or event-based patterns in emergency reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and transformation.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and working with arrays.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, used to create insightful and aesthetically pleasing plots.
- **Matplotlib**: Supplementary visualizations alongside seaborn.

## Key Insights Gained

- The most frequent types of emergency calls (e.g., EMS, Fire, Traffic).
- Time-based trends such as peak hours for 911 calls and call volumes by day of the week.
- Geographic hot spots for emergency calls.
- Trends over time that could indicate seasonal behaviors or anomalies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
